              With over six years in web development and three years in
              technical customer support, I specialize in solving complex
              problems with intuitive solutions. I've worked with technologies
              like Vue, React, Node, and PHP, creating web apps with machine
              learning and financial platforms.

              Passionate about delivering user-friendly applications, I thrive
              on new challenges and impactful projects. Outside of work, I enjoy
